# Tiny React

Try to understand how React library works in a subsential way ~

## What?

This is a tiny project for `recalling` the knowledge of how Virtual DOM works with some basic React features (mock).

## How?

- `createElement` function: create virtual DOM elements.

- `render` function: add converted JSX elements into a real DOM element.

- `Component` class: used for class component definition, `eg: class AComponent extends Component { render() { return <div>b=Base compoennt class get extended from AComponent</div> } }`

- `diff` function: used for diffing virtual DOM elements and updating the real DOM elements.


## Run project locally

npm start
# Then start to understand how the important concepts works in React
